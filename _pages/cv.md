Education
======
* Ph.D in Artificial Intelligence, Queen's University, (in progress)
* M.Sc. in Data Science and Machine Learning, Trent University
* B.E. in Engineering Physics/Applied Physics, Cornell University

Research experience
======
* Doctoral Student at Queen's University  
Researching interpretable neural networks, and evolutionary neural architecture search and optimization for biomedical applications.
Projects:
  * Permutation-invariant representation of neural networks
  * Evolutionary neural architecture search through dropout
  * Inducing modular structure in neural networks for interpretability
  * Reinforcement learning for landmark detection in medical images

* MSc Student at Trent University (2018-2020)  
  For my thesis, I designed a new method of incorporating graph neural networks into LSTM neural networks to forecast multiple time series with complex relationships. This solved problems with existing spatiotemporal models on both simulated and real-world sensory data. Other research:
  * Empirical comparison of methods for estimating the uncertainty in machine learning predictions.
  * Mitigating long-term error accumulation in time series forecasting through feature engineering.
  * Built neural network models for forecasting electricity demand (for Lowfoot Inc.)

* Research Assistant at Cornell University (2007-2010)
  * Developed flight and camera code for satellite as member of CUSAT project team. Performed hardware integration tests.
  * Implemented noise reduction algorithms and wrote microcontroller software for Formula SAE team.


* Research Assistant at Trent University (2005-2007)
  * Designed and built signal amplification PCB to collect spectral data.
  * Assembled injection lock for diode laser from schematics.
  * Built simulations using MATLAB to test control theory models and compare with experimental data.

Teaching experience
======
* Course Instructor at Trent Univeristy (2020)
  * Developed and taught Math 1080H at Trent University. Students learned real-world applications of logic, geometry, financial math and statistics.

* Graduate Teaching Assistant at Trent University (2017-2019)
  * Taught seminars in multivariable calculus, physics, discrete mathematics and combinatorics.
  * Taught classes in Python and computer algebra systems.
  * Wrote and graded quizzes and assignments, held office hours and provided extra tutoring to students.
